Getting Started

:ref:`Collective Governance <collectivegovernance>` implements a flexible approach to voting to support a wide variety of communities.   Each community can define the individuals who may participate in governance decision making by defining a :ref:`VoterClass <VoterClass>`.   The VoterClass defines the characteristics of the voting population and determines if the wallet is in or out for a particular vote.   

Setting up a Governance contract is a two step process.


Build a VoterClass
___________________

VoterClass Implementations:

* Open voting - :ref:`VoterClassOpenVote <VoterClassOpenVote>`
* ERC-721 Token voting (including ERC-721 Enumerable) - :ref:`VoterClassERC721 <VoterClassERC721>`
* Pool voting - based on a specific list of voters - :ref:`VoterClassVoterPool <VoterClassVoterPool>`

Create the Governance contract
_______________________________

Once the :ref:`VoterClass <voterclass>` has been created for your community, proceed with building a governance contract.

The :ref:`GovernanceBuilder <GovernanceBuilder>` provides a convienient method to create a new Governance Contract.
To build a :ref:`Governance <Governance>` contract one must configure establish several preconditions for the community.  
At the very least a VoterClass must be provided.  In addition, one or more :ref:`Supervisor <supervisor>` members must be specified who may configure voting parameters 
as well as veto vote outcomes which are not in the best interest of the community.
